You must act as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant that is capable of generating Home Assistant automations for a specific IoT deployment.
Below, the IoT scenario description is provided, along with a goal that the automations must accomplish and a target entity of interest. Finally, the generated rules, reprresenting a commonsense behaviour, must be displayed.

Consider two areas in my home: the family room and the kitchen nook. They are part of a single open space. The family room has a smart light named family_room_lamp and an occupancy sensor named family_room_sensor. The kitchen nook also has a smart light, named kitchen_nook_light, and an occupancy sensor, named kitchen_nook_sensor. Only the family room has a window with smart curtains named family_room_curtains.

The goal is to generate rules to illuminate the kitchen nook excluding primary light fixtures in case of these are not working, available, etc.

Certainly! It sounds like you have a smart home setup that includes smart lights and occupancy sensors in your family room and kitchen nook, as well as smart curtains in your family room. The automation goal is to illuminate the kitchen nook when needed, excluding the use of its primary light fixture.

### Assumptions:
- If the kitchen nook's primary light is unavailable, then we assume that the family room's light and curtains can be used as secondary light sources for the kitchen nook.
- The occupancy sensors trigger when someone is present in the respective rooms.
- All devices are connected to a home automation system capable of handling these rules (e.g., Home Assistant).

### Commonsense Behavior Rules:
1. Rule 1: If the kitchen nook is occupied and its primary light is off or unavailable, turn on the family room lamp.
```yaml
alias: "Illuminate Kitchen Nook using Family Room Lamp"
trigger:
  platform: state
  entity_id: sensor.kitchen_nook_sensor
  to: 'occupied'
condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: light.kitchen_nook_light
    state: 'off'
action:
  service: light.turn_on
  entity_id: light.family_room_lamp
```

2. Rule 2: If the kitchen nook becomes unoccupied, and the family room is also unoccupied, turn off the family room lamp.
```yaml
alias: "Turn Off Family Room Lamp if Both Rooms Unoccupied"
trigger:
  platform: state
  entity_id: sensor.kitchen_nook_sensor
  to: 'unoccupied'
condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: sensor.family_room_sensor
    state: 'unoccupied'
action:
  service: light.turn_off
  entity_id: light.family_room_lamp
```

3. Rule 3: If the kitchen nook is occupied and its primary light is off or unavailable during the daytime, open the family room curtains.
```yaml
alias: "Open Family Room Curtains for Kitchen Nook Daytime Illumination"
trigger:
  platform: state
  entity_id: sensor.kitchen_nook_sensor
  to: 'occupied'
condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: light.kitchen_nook_light
    state: 'off'
  - condition: sun
    before: sunset
    after: sunrise
action:
  service: cover.open_cover
  entity_id: cover.family_room_curtains
```

4. Rule 4: If both the kitchen nook and the family room are unoccupied, close the family room curtains.
```yaml
alias: "Close Family Room Curtains if Both Rooms Unoccupied"
trigger:
  platform: state
  entity_id: sensor.kitchen_nook_sensor, sensor.family_room_sensor
  to: 'unoccupied'
condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: sensor.kitchen_nook_sensor
    state: 'unoccupied'
  - condition: state
    entity_id: sensor.family_room_sensor
    state: 'unoccupied'
action:
  service: cover.close_cover
  entity_id: cover.family_room_curtains
```

These rules should achieve your goal of illuminating the kitchen nook when its primary light fixture is off or unavailable, by utilizing the smart devices in the family room. Feel free to adjust the YAML code according to the specific configuration and syntax of your home automation system.

Respuesta commonsense bastante buena, ya que tiene en cuenta que la adyacencia de áreas en un mismo espacio y que, por ello, puede usarse la lámpara de la área contigua como backup. Pero:

- Respuesta no procesable: texto plano, preparado para leer.
- Define los sensores de ocupación como sensor, en vez de como sensor binario de tipo occupancy (binary_sensor, con estados 'on' para ocupado y 'off' para desocupado), que es la solución más común.
- Considera que la lámpara de la cocina puede estar apagada, pero no que esté rota o no disponible (estado 'off' vs. estado 'unavailable' o un estado alternativo que indique que la lámpara no está disponible).
- En la última regla, cierra las cortinas de la sala de estar si ambas áreas están desocupadas, pero no tiene mucho sentido, ya que no sería necesario porque, al contrario de lo que sucede con la luz, no supone un gasto energético.
