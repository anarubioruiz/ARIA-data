You need to function as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant capable of creating Answer Set Programming rules for a particular IoT deployment. These rules will utilize the ASP-Core-2 language format and incorporate SOSA ontology class and property names as syntax.

Here's how it works: I'll provide you with a description of an IoT scenario, along with the goal that the automation should achieve, and the specific entity we're interested in: the target. After that, you'll generate the rules for us.

Now, I'll give you some example cases, and your task is to complete the final case by applying common sense, just as has been done in the previous cases.

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
Visualize two rooms, lounge and studio. The lounge holds a smart chandelier called LoungeChandelier and an occupancy sensor named LoungeOccupancy. The studio is equipped with a smart table lamp titled StudioLamp and an occupancy sensor named StudioOccupancy. The rooms are interconnected by a swinging door with a door sensor named LoungeStudioDoor.

### GOAL
illuminate, exclude primary light fixtures

### TARGET
lounge

### RULES
```yaml
- description: "Alternative lighting - Turn on studio lamp when occupancy detected at lounge and LoungeStudioDoor is open"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.LoungeOccupancy
    to: "on"
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.Lounge_alternative_lighting
      state: "on"
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.LoungeStudioDoor
      state: "on"
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.StudioLamp
- description: "Alternative lighting - Turn off studio lamp when no occupancy detected at lounge"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.LoungeOccupancy
    to: "off"
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.Lounge_alternative_lighting
      state: "on"
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.StudioOccupancy
      state: "off"
  action:
    service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.StudioLamp
```

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The deployment has two spaces, the living area and the dining area, which are located in the same physical space in an open concept floor. The living area has a smart light bulb called living_area_light, and an occupancy sensor called living_area_occupancy. The dining area has a smart light bulb called dining_area_light, and an occupancy sensor called dining_area_occupancy. Only the living area has a window equipped with controllable blinds, called living_area_blinds.

### GOAL
illuminate, exclude primary light fixtures

### TARGET
dining area

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The deployment has two rooms, living_room and kitchen. living_room has a smart light bulb called SB1, and a occupancy sensor called OS1; kitchen has a smart light bulb called SB2, and a occupancy sensor called OS2. Both spaces are connected by a door.

### GOAL
illuminate, exclude primary light fixtures

### TARGET
living_room

### RULES
```yaml
# No applicable rules can be generated.
```

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The space to automate is composed by my den and a music room. Both rooms are equipped with a smart light bulb and a occupancy sensor, and are connected by a door.

### GOAL
illuminate, exclude primary light fixtures

### TARGET
den

```
The rules provided align with the goal of illuminating the target area using alternative light fixtures (i.e., those not in the target area). These automations trigger based on occupancy in the target room, and also factor in conditions like whether alternative lighting is enabled (using input_boolean) and if the adjacent space is vacant or not.

<!-- comments -->
Al contrario que en la query en la que se proporcionan explicación a las reglas, aquí se asume que por el hecho de ser dos espacios adyacentes, uno puede iluminar al otro sin tener en cuenta nada más. Esto es una prueba clara de que las explicaciones ayudan a entender el razonamiento de las reglas.

La respuesta en este caso no es procesable (incluye texto explicativo al final después de las reglas). Esto se solventa con la sección EXPLANATION, que se incluye en la query final.
