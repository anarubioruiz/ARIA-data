You need to function as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant capable of creating Answer Set Programming rules for a particular IoT deployment. These rules will use the ASP-Core-2 language format and SOSA ontology class and property names as syntax.

Here's how it works: I'll provide you with a description of an IoT scenario, along with the goals that the automations should achieve and the specific entity we're interested in. After that, you'll generate the rules for us.

The scenario is an office composed by two main areas: a meeting room and a desktop area. These two spaces are not conected, but are adjacent by a glass wall. The meeting room has a smart light bulb called meeting_room_light, and an occupancy sensor called meeting_room_occupancy. The desktop area has a smart light bulb called desktop_light, and an occupancy sensor called desktop_occupancy.

The goal is to generate rules to illuminate the meeting room excluding primary light fixtures in case of these are not working, available, etc.

In this office IoT scenario, you have two primary areas: a meeting room and a desktop area, each with its own smart light bulb and occupancy sensor. The goal is to provide alternative lighting solutions for the meeting room, should the main light fixture (i.e., meeting_room_light) fail to work. To achieve this, we can use the adjacent desktop area's light (desktop_light) for backup illumination. Here are the automation rules:

### Rule 1: Turn on Meeting Room Light When Occupied
```yaml
alias: "Turn on Meeting Room Light When Occupied"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.meeting_room_occupancy
    to: 'on'
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.meeting_room_light
```
### Rule 2: Turn off Meeting Room Light When Unoccupied
```yaml
alias: "Turn off Meeting Room Light When Unoccupied"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.meeting_room_occupancy
    to: 'off'
action:
  - service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.meeting_room_light

```
### Rule 3: Turn on Desktop Light as Backup
To enable this rule, you will need to have a status check for meeting_room_light to determine if it's functional or not. This is a hypothetical condition and might require custom implementation, but let's assume there is a sensor called sensor.meeting_room_light_status that is 'ok' when functional and 'fail' when not.

```yaml
alias: "Turn on Desktop Light as Backup"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.meeting_room_occupancy
    to: 'on'
condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: sensor.meeting_room_light_status
    state: 'fail'
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.desktop_light
```
### Rule 4: Turn off Desktop Light as Backup
```yaml
alias: "Turn off Desktop Light as Backup"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.meeting_room_occupancy
    to: 'off'
action:
  - service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.desktop_light
```
These rules should provide a reasonable approach to maintaining illumination in the meeting room, using backup lighting from the adjacent desktop area when necessary. Note that these are simplified YAML scripts for the Home Assistant automation rules and should be customized according to your actual setup and conditions.

Respuesta commonsense bastante buena, ya que tiene en cuenta que la pared es de cristal y que por adyacencia puede usarse la lámpara de la otra habitación como backup. Pero:

- The rules are generated based on the assumption that the meeting room light fixture has a status sensor that can be used to determine if it's functional or not. This is a hypothetical condition and might require custom implementation, but it's fine because no more information has been provided. This could vary from one request to another. Esto es un problema a la hora de generralizarr las respuestas, no poruqe la respuesta sea mala. De hecho es muy buena. Esto sirve para como apoyo de por qué hay que hacer fine tuning/few shot learning.
- Respuesta no procesable: texto plano, preparado para leer.
- Genera las reglas de iluminación normal, aunque no son requeridas.
- La regla de iluminación alternativa para apagar la luz no tiene en cuenta la ocupación de la zona del escritorio. Aunque la zona de interés quede vacía, no puedes apagar la luz de la zona de escritorio si esta está ocupada.
