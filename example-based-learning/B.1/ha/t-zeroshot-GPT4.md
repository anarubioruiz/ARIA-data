You need to operate as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant capable of creating Home Assistant automation rules (in YAML) for the functioning of a specific intelligent environment.

Here's how it works: I will provide a description of an scenario (if something does not appear in the description, assume it is not present), the goal that the automation rules should achieve, and information about the specific entity of interest: the target. Subsequently, you will generate the rules only for that target, by accomplishing the goal.

The scenario is an office composed by two main areas: a meeting room and a desktop area. These two spaces are not connected, but are adjacent by a glass wall. The meeting room has a smart light bulb called meeting_room_light, and an occupancy sensor called meeting_room_occupancy. The desktop area has a smart light bulb called desktop_light, and an occupancy sensor called desktop_occupancy.

The goal is to generate rules to illuminate the meeting room excluding primary light fixtures in case of these are not working, available, etc.

In this office IoT scenario, you have two primary areas: a meeting room and a desktop area, each with its own smart light bulb and occupancy sensor. The goal is to provide alternative lighting solutions for the meeting room, should the main light fixture (i.e., meeting_room_light) fail to work. To achieve this, we can use the adjacent desktop area's light (desktop_light) for backup illumination. Here are the automation rules:

### Rule 1: Turn on Meeting Room Light When Occupied
```yaml
alias: "Turn on Meeting Room Light When Occupied"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.meeting_room_occupancy
    to: 'on'
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.meeting_room_light
```
### Rule 2: Turn off Meeting Room Light When Unoccupied
```yaml
alias: "Turn off Meeting Room Light When Unoccupied"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.meeting_room_occupancy
    to: 'off'
action:
  - service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.meeting_room_light

```
### Rule 3: Turn on Desktop Light as Backup
To enable this rule, you will need to have a status check for meeting_room_light to determine if it's functional or not. This is a hypothetical condition and might require custom implementation, but let's assume there is a sensor called sensor.meeting_room_light_status that is 'ok' when functional and 'fail' when not.

```yaml
alias: "Turn on Desktop Light as Backup"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.meeting_room_occupancy
    to: 'on'
condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: sensor.meeting_room_light_status
    state: 'fail'
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.desktop_light
```
### Rule 4: Turn off Desktop Light as Backup
```yaml
alias: "Turn off Desktop Light as Backup"
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.meeting_room_occupancy
    to: 'off'
action:
  - service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.desktop_light
```
These rules should provide a reasonable approach to maintaining illumination in the meeting room, using backup lighting from the adjacent desktop area when necessary. Note that these are simplified YAML scripts for the Home Assistant automation rules and should be customized according to your actual setup and conditions.
