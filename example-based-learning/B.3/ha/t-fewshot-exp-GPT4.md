You need to operate as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant capable of creating Home Assistant automation rules (in YAML) for the functioning of a specific intelligent environment.

Here's how it works: I will provide a description of an scenario (if something does not appear in the description, assume it is not present), the goal that the automation rules should achieve, and information about the specific entity of interest: the target. Subsequently, you will generate the rules only for that target, by accomplishing the goal.

Now, I will present some example cases. Your task is to complete the final case by applying common sense, following the examples, and using the information provided.

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
Visualize two rooms, lounge and studio. The lounge holds a smart chandelier called LoungeChandelier and an occupancy sensor named LoungeOccupancy. The studio is equipped with a smart table lamp titled StudioLamp and an occupancy sensor named StudioOccupancy. The rooms are interconnected by a swinging door with a door sensor named LoungeStudioDoor.

### GOAL
illuminate, exclude primary light fixtures

### TARGET
lounge

### RULES
```yaml
- description: "Alternative lighting - Turn on studio lamp when occupancy detected at lounge and LoungeStudioDoor is open"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.LoungeOccupancy
    to: "on"
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.Lounge_alternative_lighting
      state: "on"
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.LoungeStudioDoor
      state: "on"
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.StudioLamp
- description: "Alternative lighting - Turn off studio lamp when no occupancy detected at lounge"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.LoungeOccupancy
    to: "off"
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.Lounge_alternative_lighting
      state: "on"
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.StudioOccupancy
      state: "off"
  action:
    service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.StudioLamp
```

### EXPLANATION
The rules illuminate the lounge with fixtures that are not the primary ones. The first rule turns on the studio lamp when occupancy is detected at the lounge and the door is open (the light can not reach the lounge if it can not pass through the door). The second rule turns off the studio lamp when no occupancy is detected at the lounge and no occupancy is detected at the studio.
## END

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The deployment has two spaces, the living area and the dining area, which are located in the same physical space in an open concept floor. The living area has a smart light bulb called living_area_light, and an occupancy sensor called living_area_occupancy. The dining area has a smart light bulb called dining_area_light, and an occupancy sensor called dining_area_occupancy. Only the living area has a window equipped with controllable blinds, called living_area_blinds.

### GOAL
illuminate, exclude primary light fixtures

### TARGET
dining area

### RULES
```yaml
- description: "Alternative lighting - at night, turn on living area light when occupancy detected at dining area"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.dining_area_occupancy
    to: "on"
  condition:
    - condition: sun
      after: sunset
      before: sunrise
    - condition: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.dining_area_alternative_lighting
      state: "on"
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.living_area_light
- description: "Alternative lighting - during the day, open living area blinds when occupancy detected at dining area"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.dining_area_occupancy
    to: "on"
  condition:
    - condition: sun
      after: sunrise
      before: sunset
    - condition: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.dining_area_alternative_lighting
      state: "on"
  action:
    service: cover.open_cover
    entity_id: cover.living_area_blinds
- description: "Alternative lighting - turn off living area light when no occupancy detected at dining area"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.dining_area_occupancy
    to: "off"
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.dining_area_alternative_lighting
      state: "on"
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.living_area_occupancy
      state: "off"
  action:
    service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.living_area_light
```

### EXPLANATION
The rules illuminate the lounge with fixtures that are not the primary ones. The second rule opens the living area blinds when occupancy is detected at the dining area and it is day, prioritizing natural light for energy efficiency. The first rule turns on the living area light when occupancy is detected at the dining area and it is night (there is no natural light available at night). The third rule turns off the living area light when no occupancy is detected at the dining area and no occupancy is detected at the living area.
## END

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The deployment has two rooms, living_room and kitchen. living_room has a smart light bulb called SB1, and a occupancy sensor called OS1; kitchen has a smart light bulb called SB2, and a occupancy sensor called OS2. Both spaces are connected by a door.

### GOAL
illuminate, exclude primary light fixtures

### TARGET
living_room

### RULES
```yaml
# No applicable rules can be generated.
```

### EXPLANATION
No rules are generated because alternative lighting is not possible in this scenario. Although the kitchen is connected to the living room, it is not known whether the door is open or closed. Therefore, it is not possible to illuminate the living room with fixtures that are not the primary ones because it is not possible to know whether the light can reach the living room.

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The space to automate is composed by my den and a music room. Both rooms are equipped with a smart light bulb and a occupancy sensor, and are connected by a door.

### GOAL
illuminate, exclude primary light fixtures

### TARGET
den

<!-- response -->

### RULES
```yaml
- description: "Alternative lighting - Turn on music room light when occupancy detected at den and door is unknown (no door sensor)"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.den_occupancy
    to: "on"
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.den_alternative_lighting
      state: "on"
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.music_room_light
- description: "Alternative lighting - Turn off music room light when no occupancy detected at den"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.den_occupancy
    to: "off"
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.den_alternative_lighting
      state: "on"
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.music_room_occupancy
      state: "off"
  action:
    service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.music_room_light

```

### EXPLANATION
No rules can ensure the effectiveness of illuminating the den with light from the music room, as the status of the connecting door is unknown. However, the automations are still created with the assumption that the door may be open, as there's no information to confirm or deny it.

The first rule turns on the music room light when occupancy is detected in the den. The second rule turns off the music room light when no occupancy is detected in both the den and the music room. Both rules also check an input_boolean for whether alternative lighting is desired for the den, allowing for manual control or further automation logic.
## END

<!-- comments -->
Asume que hay un sensor de puertas aunque la descripción del escenario no se indica. Aquí debería haber dicho que no pueden generarse reglas para iluminación alternativa, pero al menos es consciente de que lo está dando por hecho. Si continúo la conversación añadiendo que la puerta puede estar cerrada y que no existe un sensorr de puertas, llega a la conclusión correcta/esperada:

<!-- response -->
If the door is closed and there's no sensor information to determine its state dynamically, then you would not be able to illuminate the den using fixtures from the music room. In such a case, alternative lighting isn't feasible due to the physical barrier created by the closed door.

### RULES
```yaml
# No applicable rules can be generated.
```
No rules are generated because alternative lighting is not possible in this scenario with the door closed. The light from the music room cannot reach the den, so it is not possible to illuminate the den with fixtures that are not the primary ones.
