You need to operate as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant capable of creating Answer Set Programming rules for the functioning of a specific intelligent environment. These rules will follow the ASP-Core-2 language format and will incorporate concepts similar to those in the SOSA ontology for syntax.

Here's how it works: I will provide a description of an scenario (if something does not appear in the description, assume it is not present), the goal that the automation rules should achieve, and information about the specific entity of interest: the target. Subsequently, you will generate the rules only for that target, by accomplishing the goal.

Now, I will present some example cases. Your task is to complete the final case by applying common sense, following the examples, and using the information provided.

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
Consider there is one room named LivingRoom. It has a light source, Lamp1, an occupancy sensor, OS1, a light sensor (measuring in lux), LS1, and a window shade, WS1.

### GOAL
illuminate

### TARGET
LivingRoom

### RULES
```
% Automation 1
action(turn_on, lamp1) :- cond(1), cond(2), cond(3).
cond(1) :- observation(os1, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(os1, OB_ID), "on").
cond(2) :- observation(sun, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(sun, OB_ID), "sunset").
cond(3) :- observation(ls1, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(ls1, OB_ID), VALUE),
           VALUE < 150.  % light level < 150 lux

% Automation 2
action(open, ws1)       :- cond(1), cond(4), cond(5).
action(turn_off, lamp1) :- cond(1), cond(4), cond(5).
cond(4) :- observation(sun, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(sun, OB_ID), "sunrise").
cond(5) :- observation(ws1, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(ws1, OB_ID), "close").

% Automation 3
action(turn_on, lamp1) :- cond(1), cond(4), cond(3), cond(6).
cond(6) :- observation(ws1, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(ws1, OB_ID), "open").

% Automation 4
action(turn_off, lamp1) :- cond(7).
cond(7) :- observation(os1, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(os1, OB_ID), "off").
```

### EXPLANATION
Due to the available devices and their location, four rules can be generated. The first rule turns on the light when occupancy is detected if the lighting is insufficient and it is nighttime (the state of the blinds is irrelevant because there is no natural light). The second rule attempts to turn off the light and open the blinds if they are closed, occupancy is detected, and it is daytime, in order to reduce energy consumption by using natural light. The third rule turns on the light if the room is occupied, it is daytime, and despite the blinds being open, the lighting is insufficient. Finally, the fourth rule turns off the light when there is no occupancy, as it is not necessary for the room to be illuminated when there is no one in it.
## END

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The space to automate, my den, is equipped with a smart fixture named Den Light, an occupancy sensor named Den Occupancy, and another sensor, Den Light Detector, that measures brightness. No window covers are in the kitchen (but there are windows).

### GOAL
illuminate

### TARGET
den

### RULES
```
% Automation 1
action(turn_on, den_light) :- cond(1), cond(2).
cond(1) :- observation(ps1, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(ps1, OB_ID), "on").
cond(2) :- observation(ls1, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(ls1, OB_ID), VALUE),
           VALUE < 150.  % light level < 150 lux

% Automation 2
action(turn_off, den_light) :- cond(3).
cond(3) :- observation(ps1, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(ps1, OB_ID), "off").
```

### EXPLANATION
Since there are no blinds, only two rules can be generated. The first rule turns on the light when occupancy is detected if the lighting is insufficient (the presence of windows in this case is not relevant because the need to illuminate the room is indicated by the light sensor). The second rule turns off the light when there is no occupancy, as it is not necessary for the room to be illuminated when there is no one in it.
## END

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The scenario is conformed by the kitchen and the hall lighting systems. While in the kitchen there is a smart lamp, a window and an occupancy sensor, in the hall there is a smart lamp located in a wall and a sensor to monitor the occupancy of the room.

### GOAL
illuminate

### TARGET
kitchen

### RULES
```
action(turn_on, kitchen_smart_lamp) :- cond(1), cond(2).  % cond(1) and cond(2) are true
cond(1) :- observation(kitchen_occupancy_sensor, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(kitchen_occupancy_sensor, OB_ID), "on").
cond(2) :- observation(sun, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(sun, OB_ID), "sunset").

% Automation 2
action(turn_off, kitchen_smart_lamp) :- { cond(3); cond(4) } = 1.  % cond(3) or cond(4) is true
cond(3) :- observation(kitchen_occupancy_sensor, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(kitchen_occupancy_sensor, OB_ID), "off").
cond(4) :- observation(sun, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(sun, OB_ID), "sunrise").
```

### EXPLANATION
The first rule turns on the kitchen light when occupancy is detected and it is nighttime, because there is no natural light. The second rule turns off the kitchen light when there is no occupancy or it is daytime because, in the latter case, natural light can be utilized through the window (assuming there are no blinds).
## END

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The deployment covers three spaces. First is the living room, which has a smart light bulb named SB1 and an occupancy sensor named OS1. Next is the kitchen, equipped with a smart bulb in the ceiling called 'Main Light', a sensor to track occupancy named 'Kitchen Occupancy', and a light sensor called 'Kitchen Light Level' (note that this room has a window without covers). Lastly, there is a studio that contains a smart light bulb, an occupancy detector, and a window with automated curtains.

### GOAL
illuminate

### TARGET
living_room

<!-- response -->

## RULES
```
% Automation 1
action(turn_on, sb1) :- cond(1).  % cond(1) is true
cond(1) :- observation(os1, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(os1, OB_ID), "on").

% Automation 2
action(turn_off, sb1) :- cond(2).  % cond(2) is true
cond(2) :- observation(os1, OB_ID),
           hasSimpleResult(observation(os1, OB_ID), "off").
```

### EXPLANATION
For the living_room, there are two straightforward rules. The first rule turns on the smart light bulb (SB1) when occupancy is detected in the living room. The second rule turns off the smart light bulb when there is no occupancy detected in the living room. The living room doesn't have windows, so external lighting conditions are irrelevant for the automation rules for this target. The other rooms and their devices (kitchen and studio) are not relevant to the target "living_room" and, therefore, have not been included in the rules.
