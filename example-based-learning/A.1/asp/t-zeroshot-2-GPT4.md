You need to operate as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant capable of creating Answer Set Programming rules for the functioning of a specific intelligent environment. These rules will follow the ASP-Core-2 language format and will incorporate concepts similar to those in the SOSA ontology for syntax.

Here's how it works: I will provide a description of an scenario (if something does not appear in the description, assume it is not present), the goal that the automation rules should achieve, and information about the specific entity of interest: the target. Subsequently, you will generate the rules only for that target, by accomplishing the goal.

The deployment covers three spaces. First is the living room, which has a smart light bulb named SB1 and an occupancy sensor named OS1. Next is the kitchen, equipped with a smart bulb in the ceiling called 'Main Light', a sensor to track occupancy named 'Kitchen Occupancy', and a light sensor called 'Kitchen Light Level' (note that this room has a window without covers). Lastly, there is a studio that contains a smart light bulb, an occupancy detector, and a window with automated curtains.

The goal is to generate rules to illuminate the kitchen.

## RESPONSE
To create Answer Set Programming (ASP) rules for the functioning of the kitchen's intelligent environment in line with the specified scenario, I'll focus on the smart bulb in the kitchen, named 'Main Light', the occupancy sensor 'Kitchen Occupancy', and the light sensor 'Kitchen Light Level'. The goal is to illuminate the kitchen effectively, taking into account both occupancy and ambient light level. These rules will be formatted in ASP-Core-2 language and draw upon concepts similar to those in the SOSA ontology for syntax.

Here are the ASP rules for this scenario:

1. **Rule to Turn On the Light When Someone Enters the Kitchen:**

```
{ light_on("Main Light") } :- occupancy("Kitchen Occupancy", true).
```

This rule states that the main light in the kitchen can be turned on if the occupancy sensor detects someone in the kitchen.

2. **Rule to Turn Off the Light When the Kitchen is Empty:**

```
:- light_on("Main Light"), occupancy("Kitchen Occupancy", false).
```

This rule ensures that the main light in the kitchen is turned off when there is no one in the kitchen.

3. **Rule to Keep the Light Off if There is Sufficient Natural Light:**

```
:- light_on("Main Light"), light_level("Kitchen Light Level", high).
```

This rule ensures that the main light in the kitchen remains off if the natural light level is high, indicating that there is sufficient natural light.

4. **Rule to Turn On the Light if Natural Light is Insufficient and Kitchen is Occupied:**

```
{ light_on("Main Light") } :- occupancy("Kitchen Occupancy", true), light_level("Kitchen Light Level", low).
```

This rule states that if the kitchen is occupied and the natural light level is low, the main light should be turned on.

5. **Rule to Turn Off the Light When Natural Light Becomes Sufficient:**

```
:- light_on("Main Light"), light_level("Kitchen Light Level", high), occupancy("Kitchen Occupancy", true).
```

This rule ensures that the main light is turned off when there is sufficient natural light, even if the kitchen is occupied.

These rules collectively ensure that the kitchen is illuminated based on occupancy and the level of natural light, achieving the goal of efficient and intelligent lighting control in the kitchen.
