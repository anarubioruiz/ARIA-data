You need to operate as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant capable of creating Answer Set Programming rules for the functioning of a specific intelligent environment. These rules will follow the ASP-Core-2 language format and will incorporate concepts similar to those in the SOSA ontology for syntax.

Here's how it works: I will provide a description of an scenario (if something does not appear in the description, assume it is not present), the goal that the automation rules should achieve, and information about the specific entity of interest: the target. Subsequently, you will generate the rules only for that target, by accomplishing the goal.

The deployment covers three spaces. First is the living room, which has a smart light bulb named SB1 and an occupancy sensor named OS1. Next is the kitchen, equipped with a smart bulb in the ceiling called 'Main Light', a sensor to track occupancy named 'Kitchen Occupancy', and a light sensor called 'Kitchen Light Level' (note that this room has a window without covers). Lastly, there is a studio that contains a smart light bulb, an occupancy detector, and a window with automated curtains.

The goal is to generate rules to illuminate the living room.

## RESPONSE
To create ASP-Core-2 rules for illuminating the living room in your intelligent environment, we'll focus on the target entities in the living room: the smart light bulb SB1 and the occupancy sensor OS1. We'll base the rules on SOSA ontology concepts for syntax, keeping in mind the entities and their characteristics.

### Entities in the Living Room:
1. SB1 (Smart Light Bulb)
2. OS1 (Occupancy Sensor)

### Goal:
- To automate the illumination of the living room based on
occupancy detection.

### ASP-Core-2 Rules for the Living Room:
Rule 1: Detecting Occupancy

When the occupancy sensor (OS1) detects a presence in the living room, it should trigger the smart light bulb (SB1) to turn on.

```
occupied_living_room :- os1_detected_presence.
```

This rule states that the living room is considered occupied (`occupied_living_room`) if the occupancy sensor OS1 detects presence (`os1_detected_presence`).

Rule 2: Turning on the Light

When the living room is occupied, the smart light bulb (SB1) should be turned on.

```
activate_sb1 :- occupied_living_room.
```

This rule activates the smart bulb SB1 (`activate_sb1`) when the living room is occupied (`occupied_living_room`).

Rule 3: No Occupancy

If the occupancy sensor (OS1) does not detect any presence for a predefined duration, the light should be turned off.

```
not_occupied_living_room :- not os1_detected_presence, time_limit_exceeded.
deactivate_sb1 :- not_occupied_living_room.
```

This set of rules states that the living room is considered not occupied (`not_occupied_living_room`) if no presence is detected (not os1_detected_presence) and a certain time limit is exceeded (`time_limit_exceeded`). Subsequently, the smart bulb SB1 is deactivated (`deactivate_sb1`) under these conditions.

Rule 4: Manual Override (Optional)

In case of a manual override, the automatic rules can be bypassed.

```
activate_sb1 :- manual_override_on.
deactivate_sb1 :- manual_override_off.
```

These rules allow for manual activation (`manual_override_on`) or deactivation (`manual_override_off`) of the smart bulb SB1.

These rules should be integrated into your ASP-Core-2 environment, ensuring that the syntax matches the system's requirements and that the predicates (`like os1_detected_presence`, `time_limit_exceeded`, `manual_override_on/off`) are correctly defined in your system to correspond with real-world triggers and actions.
