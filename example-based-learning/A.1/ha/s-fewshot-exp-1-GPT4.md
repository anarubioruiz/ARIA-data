You need to operate as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant capable of creating Home Assistant automation rules (in YAML) for the functioning of a specific intelligent environment.

Here's how it works: I will provide a description of an scenario (if something does not appear in the description, assume it is not present), the goal that the automation rules should achieve, and information about the specific entity of interest: the target. Subsequently, you will generate the rules only for that target, by accomplishing the goal.

Now, I will present some example cases. Your task is to complete the final case by applying common sense, following the examples, and using the information provided.

### EXPLANATION
Due to the available devices and their location, four rules can be generated. The first rule turns on the light when occupancy is detected if the lighting is insufficient and it is nighttime (the state of the blinds is irrelevant because there is no natural light). The second rule attempts to turn off the light and open the blinds if they are closed, occupancy is detected, and it is daytime, in order to reduce energy consumption by using natural light. The third rule turns on the light if the room is occupied, it is daytime, and despite the blinds being open, the lighting is insufficient. Finally, the fourth rule turns off the light when there is no occupancy, as it is not necessary for the room to be illuminated when there is no one in it.

### EXPLANATION
Since there are no blinds, only two rules can be generated. The first rule turns on the light when occupancy is detected if the lighting is insufficient (the presence of windows in this case is not relevant because the need to illuminate the room is indicated by the light sensor). The second rule turns off the light when there is no occupancy, as it is not necessary for the room to be illuminated when there is no one in it.

### EXPLANATION
The first rule turns off the kitchen light when there is no occupancy or it is daytime because, in the latter case, natural light can be utilized through the window (assuming there are no blinds). The first rule turns on the kitchen light when occupancy is detected and it is nighttime, because there is no natural light.

### GOAL
illuminate

### TARGET
living_room

<!-- response -->

To achieve the goal of illumination in the living room, considering the available devices and their functionalities as described in the IoT deployment, the following Home Assistant automation rules can be generated:

### RULES
```yaml
- description: "Turn on the living room light when occupancy is detected"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.os1
    to: "on"
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.sb1

- description: "Turn off the living room light when no occupancy is detected"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.os1
    to: "off"
  action:
    service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.sb1
```

### EXPLANATION
- The first rule activates the living room light (`light.sb1`) when the occupancy sensor (`binary_sensor.os1`) detects someone in the living room. This ensures that the room is illuminated when it is being used.
- The second rule deactivates the living room light when the occupancy sensor no longer detects presence. This is a measure to conserve energy when the living room is not in use.

These rules do not consider natural light levels as there is no light sensor in the living room, and they operate purely based on occupancy detection.
