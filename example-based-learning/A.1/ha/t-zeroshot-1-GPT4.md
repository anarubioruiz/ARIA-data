You need to operate as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant capable of creating Home Assistant automation rules (in YAML) for the functioning of a specific intelligent environment.

Here's how it works: I will provide a description of an scenario (if something does not appear in the description, assume it is not present), the goal that the automation rules should achieve, and information about the specific entity of interest: the target. Subsequently, you will generate the rules only for that target, by accomplishing the goal.

The deployment covers three spaces. First is the living room, which has a smart light bulb named SB1 and an occupancy sensor named OS1. Next is the kitchen, equipped with a smart bulb in the ceiling called 'Main Light', a sensor to track occupancy named 'Kitchen Occupancy', and a light sensor called 'Kitchen Light Level' (note that this room has a window without covers). Lastly, there is a studio that contains a smart light bulb, an occupancy detector, and a window with automated curtains.

The goal is to generate rules to illuminate the living room.

To create Home Assistant automation rules for illuminating the living room, we need to focus on the smart light bulb (SB1) and the occupancy sensor (OS1) in that room. Based on your scenario, we don't need to integrate other spaces or devices for this specific task. The rules will be designed to control SB1 based on the data from OS1.

Here are the rules:

1. **Turn on SB1 when occupancy is detected:** When OS1 detects occupancy in the living room, SB1 should turn on. This ensures the room is lit when someone is present.

2. **Turn off SB1 when no occupancy is detected:** Conversely, when OS1 no longer detects occupancy, SB1 should turn off to save energy.

Here's how the YAML configuration for these rules might look:

```yaml
alias: "Living Room Illumination"
description: "Automate lighting in the living room based on occupancy."
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.OS1
    to: 'occupied'
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.SB1
  - delay: "00:05:00"  # 5-minute delay to check if the room is still occupied
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: sensor.OS1
            state: 'not_occupied'
        sequence:
          - service: light.turn_off
            entity_id: light.SB1
mode: restart
```

Explanation:
- **Trigger:** The automation is triggered when the state of OS1 changes to 'occupied'.
- **Actions:**
  - Initially, the light (SB1) is turned on.
  - After a 5-minute delay (to allow for temporary absence like leaving the room briefly), the automation checks again.
  - If the room is no longer occupied (OS1 state is 'not_occupied'), SB1 is turned off.
- **Mode:** 'Restart' mode ensures that the automation restarts its sequence each time the trigger condition is met.

This configuration provides a basic and effective automation for living room lighting based on occupancy. Adjustments can be made to the delay or conditions based on specific needs or behaviors observed in the living room.
