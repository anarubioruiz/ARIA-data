You need to operate as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant capable of creating Home Assistant automation rules (in YAML) for the functioning of a specific intelligent environment.

Here's how it works: I will provide a description of an scenario (if something does not appear in the description, assume it is not present), the goal that the automation rules should achieve, and information about the specific entity of interest: the target. Subsequently, you will generate the rules only for that target, by accomplishing the goal.

Now, I will present some example cases. Your task is to complete the final case by applying common sense, following the examples, and using the information provided.

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
Consider there is one room named LivingRoom. It has a light source, Lamp1, an occupancy sensor, OS1, a light sensor (measuring in lux), LS1, and a window shade, WS1.

### GOAL
illuminate

### TARGET
LivingRoom

### RULES
```

    - service: light.turn_off
      entity_id: light.lamp1
- description: "Switch on the light when presence detected and light is needed even though the shade is open during the daytime in LivingRoom"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: cover.ws1
      to: "open"
      for: '00:00:03'
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.ps1
      to: "on"
    - platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.ls1
      below: 150
  condition:
    - condition: sun
      after: sunrise
      before: sunset
    - condition: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.ls1
      below: 150
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.ps1
      state: "on"
    - condition: state
      entity_id: cover.ws1
      state: "open"
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.lamp1
- description: "Turn off lights in LivingRoom when no presence detected"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.ps1
    to: "off"
  action:
    service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.lamp1
```

### EXPLANATION
Due to the available devices and their location, four rules can be generated. The first rule turns on the light when occupancy is detected if the lighting is insufficient and it is nighttime (the state of the blinds is irrelevant because there is no natural light). The second rule attempts to turn off the light and open the blinds if they are closed, occupancy is detected, and it is daytime, in order to reduce energy consumption by using natural light. The third rule turns on the light if the room is occupied, it is daytime, and despite the blinds being open, the lighting is insufficient. Finally, the fourth rule turns off the light when there is no occupancy, as it is not necessary for the room to be illuminated when there is no one in it.
## END

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The space to automate, my den, is equipped with a smart fixture named Den Light, an occupancy sensor named Den Occupancy, and another sensor, Den Light Detector, that measures brightness. No window covers are in the kitchen (but there are windows).

### GOAL
illuminate

### TARGET
den

### RULES
```
- description: "Illuminate the den when it's dark and someone is there"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.den_occupancy
      to: "on"

    entity_id: binary_sensor.den_occupancy
    to: "off"
  action:
    service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.den_light
```

### EXPLANATION
Since there are no blinds, only two rules can be generated. The first rule turns on the light when occupancy is detected if the lighting is insufficient (the presence of windows in this case is not relevant because the need to illuminate the room is indicated by the light sensor). The second rule turns off the light when there is no occupancy, as it is not necessary for the room to be illuminated when there is no one in it.
## END

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The scenario is conformed by the kitchen and the hall lighting systems. While in the kitchen there is a smart lamp, a window and an occupancy sensor, in the hall there is a smart lamp located in a wall and a sensor to monitor the occupancy of the room.

### GOAL
illuminate

### TARGET
kitchen

### RULES
```
- description: "Turn off the lamp when no occupancy detected or when the sun rises in the kitchen"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.kitchen_occupancy_sensor

    - platform: sun
      event: sunrise

      state: "on"
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.kitchen_smart_lamp
```

### EXPLANATION
The first rule turns off the kitchen light when there is no occupancy or it is daytime because, in the latter case, natural light can be utilized through the window (assuming there are no blinds). The first rule turns on the kitchen light when occupancy is detected and it is nighttime, because there is no natural light.
## END

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The deployment covers three spaces. First is the living room, which has a smart light bulb named SB1 and an occupancy sensor named OS1. Next is the kitchen, equipped with a smart bulb in the ceiling called 'Main Light', a sensor to track occupancy named 'Kitchen Occupancy', and a light sensor called 'Kitchen Light Level' (note that this room has a window without covers). Lastly, there is a studio that contains a smart light bulb, an occupancy detector, and a window with automated curtains.

illuminate

studio

### EXPLANATION
For the studio, four automation rules are created. The first rule turns on the studio light when occupancy is detected. This rule is straightforward, as the presence of an individual in the studio necessitates illumination. The second rule turns off the light when the studio is unoccupied, conserving energy when lighting is not required. The third rule opens the studio curtains during the daytime when occupancy is detected, utilizing natural light and reducing the need for artificial lighting. The last rule closes the curtains either when the studio is unoccupied, ensuring privacy and security, or at sunset, preparing the studio for evening privacy and reducing heat loss in colder months.
