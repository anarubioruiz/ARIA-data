You need to operate as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant capable of creating Home Assistant automation rules (in YAML) for the functioning of a specific intelligent environment.

Here's how it works: I will provide a description of an scenario (if something does not appear in the description, assume it is not present), the goal that the automation rules should achieve, and information about the specific entity of interest: the target. Subsequently, you will generate the rules only for that target, by accomplishing the goal.

Now, I will present some example cases. Your task is to complete the final case by applying common sense, following the examples, and using the information provided.

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
Consider there is one room named LivingRoom. It has a light source, Lamp1, an occupancy sensor, OS1, a light sensor (measuring in lux), LS1, and a window shade, WS1.

### GOAL
illuminate

### TARGET
LivingRoom

### RULES

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The space to automate, my den, is equipped with a smart fixture named Den Light, an occupancy sensor named Den Occupancy, and another sensor, Den Light Detector, that measures brightness. No window covers are in the den (but there are windows).

### GOAL
illuminate

### TARGET
den

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The scenario is conformed by the kitchen and the hall lighting systems. While in the kitchen there is a smart lamp, a window and an occupancy sensor, in the hall there is a smart lamp located in a wall and a sensor to monitor the occupancy of the room.

### GOAL
illuminate

kitchen

## START
### IoT DEPLOYMENT
The deployment covers three spaces. First is the living room, which has a smart light bulb named SB1 and an occupancy sensor named OS1. Next is the kitchen, equipped with a smart bulb in the ceiling called 'Main Light', a sensor to track occupancy named 'Kitchen Occupancy', and a light sensor called 'Kitchen Light Level' (note that this room has a window without covers). Lastly, there is a studio that contains a smart light bulb, an occupancy detector, and a window with automated curtains.

### GOAL
illuminate

### TARGET
kitchen

<!-- response -->

### RULES
```
- description: "Turn on Main Light in the kitchen when it's dark and someone is present"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.kitchen_occupancy
      to: "on"
    - platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.kitchen_light_level

  condition:
    - condition: state

  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.kitchen_occupancy
    to: "off"
  action:
    service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.main_light

- description: "Turn on Main Light in the kitchen during daytime if it's dark and someone is present"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.kitchen_occupancy
      to: "on"
    - platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.kitchen_light_level
      below: 250
  condition:
    - condition: sun
      after: sunrise
      before: sunset
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.kitchen_occupancy
      state: "on"
    - condition: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.kitchen_light_level
      below: 250
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.main_light
```

These rules will ensure that the kitchen's 'Main Light' turns on when someone is present and the light level is below a specified threshold, accommodating for both day and night scenarios. The light will automatically turn off when the kitchen is unoccupied.
