You need to operate as ARIA, an Automation Rules Intelligence Assistant capable of creating Home Assistant automation rules (in YAML) for the functioning of a specific intelligent environment.

Here's how it works: I will provide a description of an scenario (if something does not appear in the description, assume it is not present), the goal that the automation rules should achieve, and information about the specific entity of interest: the target. Subsequently, you will generate the rules only for that target, by accomplishing the goal.

The deployment covers three spaces. First is the living room, which has a smart light bulb named SB1 and an occupancy sensor named OS1. Next is the kitchen, equipped with a smart bulb in the ceiling called 'Main Light', a sensor to track occupancy named 'Kitchen Occupancy', and a light sensor called 'Kitchen Light Level' (note that this room has a window without covers). Lastly, there is a studio that contains a smart light bulb, an occupancy detector, and a window with automated curtains.

The goal is to generate rules to illuminate the kitchen.

To create Home Assistant automation rules for the kitchen's illumination, we will focus on automating the 'Main Light' based on occupancy and light levels. The entities involved are:

- `Main Light`: The smart bulb in the kitchen.
- `Kitchen Occupancy`: The sensor to track occupancy in the kitchen.
- `Kitchen Light Level`: The light sensor in the kitchen.

Here are the automation rules:

1. **Turn On the Main Light When Occupied:** The main light should turn on when someone enters the kitchen (detected by `Kitchen Occupancy`), but only if the natural light level (measured by `Kitchen Light Level`) is below a certain threshold, indicating it's dark enough to require artificial lighting.

2. **Turn Off the Main Light When Unoccupied:** Automatically turn off the main light if the kitchen is unoccupied for a certain period, e.g., 5 minutes.

The YAML configurations for these rules would look something like this:

```yaml
# Automation to turn on the main light when the kitchen is occupied and it's dark
- alias: "Turn on Main Light when Kitchen Occupied and Dark"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.kitchen_occupancy
    to: 'on'
  condition:
    condition: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.kitchen_light_level
    below: 50 # this threshold can be adjusted
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.main_light

# Automation to turn off the main light when the kitchen has been unoccupied for 5 minutes
- alias: "Turn off Main Light when Kitchen Unoccupied"
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.kitchen_occupancy
    to: 'off'
    for:
      minutes: 5
  action:
    service: light.turn_off
    entity_id: light.main_light
```

In this setup, `sensor.kitchen_occupancy` is assumed to have states 'on' (occupied) and 'off' (unoccupied), and `sensor.kitchen_light_level` reports numeric values indicating the level of natural light. Adjust the light level threshold (e.g., `50` in the first automation) based on how dark the kitchen gets. These automations should achieve the goal of efficiently illuminating the kitchen based on occupancy and natural light levels.
